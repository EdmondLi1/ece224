note it goes from 0x8000 0000 -> 0x8000 0000F
CS*0 = A31 * ~A30 _ ~A29 _ .... \_ ~A4

but this uses the fact that we nede 28signals just to encode this...
we now introduce aliasing

Here is the list of all the address mapped (just the table we see in q7):
MM: 0x0000 0000 -> 0x00FF FFFF
====
SP1: 0x8000 0000 -> 0x8000 000F
SP2: 0x8000 0010 -> 0x8000 001F
PP1: 0x8000 0020 -> 0x8000 002F
PP2: 0x8000 0030 -> 0x8000 003F

note the 2nd least sig hex, changes for SP1 -> PP2

CS1 = A31 _ ~A5 _ ~A4

- reason why A5 and A4 are used because the other ones in the (SP2, PP1, PP2) have those as active high or lows
- this new chip select uses only 3 signals rather than 28

likewise with
CS2 = A31 _ ~A5 _ A4
